1.1 DESCRIBE THE BENEFITS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF USING CLOUD SERVICES:
> High Availabity: 
    SLA (Service-level agreement): Garante um certo nível de disponibilidade em porcentagem. 
                                    Garante um tempo de atividade de cerca de 100%
    - Network outage:
    - Application failure:  Application Inseghts integration with your application to give you detailed 
                            information about the performance and reliability of your application.
    - System outage: 
    - Power outage
    - Problems with a reliant system

> Scalability, Elasticity and agility
 * Scalability: horizontal scaling (scaling out) aumenta o número de VM´s.
                verical scaling (scaling up) aumenta o poder da VM's.
 * Elasticity: thw concept of automatically scaling based on the usage patter for your application.
 * Agility: kind of speed and flexibility to quickly scale in the cloud.

 > Fault tolerance and disaster recovery: Is designed to deal with failure at a small scale, moving you,
 for example, from an unhealthy VM to a healthy VM. Disaster recovery plans are commonly referred to as 
 Business Continuaty and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans.

 > Economic benefits of the cloud: 
    - On-Promises Model (Modelo Local): 
    - Cloud Model (Modelo em nuvem): offers many economic benefits over the op-promises model

1.2 DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE (IAAS), 
    PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE (PAAS), AND SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS): Offerings in the cloud are typically 
    referred as a services. Each type of service comes with advantages and disadvantages.

    IaaS: Infrastructure refers to the hardware that your application uses, and IaaS refers to the 
    virtualized infrastructure offered by a cloud provider. Iaas services allow you to control costs effectively,
    because your only pay for them when you are using them. Iaas benefit from scaling and elasticity.

    PaaS: a cloud provider still provides the infrastructure for you, but they also provide the operating system, software installed in the 
    operating system to help you connect to databases end network systems (often referred to as middleware), and many features that enable
    you to build and manage complex cloud applications. Offer you the flexibility of controlling the application, but they affload management 
    and control of the underlying systems to the cloud provider.
