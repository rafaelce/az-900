Chapter 1 : “Understand cloud concepts”
---------

1.1 DESCRIBE THE BENEFITS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF USING CLOUD SERVICES:
    - High Availabity: 
        * SLA (Service-level agreement):  Garante um certo nível de disponibilidade em porcentagem. 
                                            Garante um tempo de atividade de cerca de 100%
    - Network outage:
    - Application failure:  Application Inseghts integration with your application to give you detailed 
                            information about the performance and reliability of your application.
    - System outage: 
    - Power outage
    - Problems with a reliant system

> Scalability, Elasticity and agility
 * Scalability: horizontal scaling (scaling out) aumenta o número de VM´s.
                verical scaling (scaling up) aumenta o poder da VM's.
 * Elasticity: Cloud providers give you ways to automatically scale based on usage patterns, resource utilization, and times of day.
                The concept of automatically scaling based on the usage patter for your application.
 * Agility: kind of speed and flexibility to quickly scale in the cloud.

 > Fault tolerance and disaster recovery: Is designed to deal with failure at a small scale, moving you,
 for example, from an unhealthy VM to a healthy VM. Disaster recovery plans are commonly referred to as 
 Business Continuaty and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans.

 > Economic benefits of the cloud: 
    - On-Promises Model (Modelo Local): 
    - Cloud Model (Modelo em nuvem): offers many economic benefits over the op-promises model

1.2 DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE (IAAS), 
    PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE (PAAS), AND SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS): Offerings in the cloud are typically 
    referred as a services. Each type of service comes with advantages and disadvantages.

    > IaaS: Infrastructure refers to the hardware that your application uses, and IaaS refers to the 
    virtualized infrastructure offered by a cloud provider. Iaas services allow you to control costs effectively,
    because your only pay for them when you are using them. Iaas benefit from scaling and elasticity.

    > PaaS: a cloud provider still provides the infrastructure for you, but they also provide the operating system, software installed in the 
    operating system to help you connect to databases end network systems (often referred to as middleware), and many features that enable
    you to build and manage complex cloud applications. Offer you the flexibility of controlling the application, but they affload management 
    and control of the underlying systems to the cloud provider. 

    As you've learned, IaaS requires you to control both the operating system and middleware components along
    with your application. When you move to PaaS, you affload the control of the operating system and middleware
    components to the cloud provider, and you're reponsible only application code. 

    > SaaS: the cloud provider controls everything. In other words, a SaaS service is software provided by a cloud provider
    that's install on infrastructure completely controlled by the hosting provider. offer you the flexibility of a pay-as-you-go model.
    Essentially, you rent your software from a service provider. When using a SaaS service, not only do you benefit from using software written and
    mainteined by someone else, but you can also benefit from allowing the cloud provider to maintain and configure the application.

1.3: DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HYBRID CLOUD MODELS: The traditional cloud model is referred to as the public cloud. 
     In addition to a public cloud model, businesses can also use a private cloud where the infrastructure is dedicated to them. 
     Finally, a hybrid cloud model represents a mixture of public and private cloud models.

     Public cloud:  Is the most common cloud model. You use a shared infrestructure that is acessible on the public network. 
     The network,storage, and VMs that your application uses are provided by a cloud provider and shared between all consumers of the public cloud.
     Microsogt Azure is an example of a public cloud. Another advantage is that you can control costs more efficiently because you only pay for
     the resources you are using.
        Disadvantages: You give up some control of the infrastructure. Security concerns with operating (public Internet).
        Another disadvantage is that it locks you into the specific configuration defined by the cloud provider.

    Private cloud: Two of the main reasons why companies choose a private cloud are: privacy and regulatory concerns.
    Unlike the public cloud, private clouds operate on a private network that is only accessible by a single organization.
    Disadvantages: If you are hosting your private cloud on-premises, you will likely spend as much on IT as you would in a non-cloud environment.

    Hybrid Cloud: Are a mixture of public and private cloud.


Chapter 2: Understand core Azure services
---------

2.1 UNDERSTAND THE CORE AZURE ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS
    - Azure regions: In order to provide Azure services to people around the world, Microsoft has created boundaries called geographies.
                     The fact that each geography contains at least two regions separated by a large physical distance is important. That’s how Azure maintains disaster recovery.
                     At each region, Microsoft has built datacenters (physical buildings) that contain the physical hardware that Azure uses.
    
    - Availability zones: The fact that regions are physically separated by hundreds of miles protects Azure users from data-loss and application outages due to disasters.
                          However, it’s also important that data and applications maintain availability when a problem occurs at a particular datacenter within a region. Microsoft developed availability zones.
                          There are at least three availability zones within each enabled region, and because each availability zone exists within its own datacenter in that region, each has a water supply, 
                          cooling system, network, and power supply that is isolated from other zones.
                          There are two categories of services that support availability zones: 
                            * zonal services: Zonal services are services such as virtual machines, managed disks used in a virtual machine, and public IP addresses used in virtual machines.
                            * zone-redundant services: services such as zone-redundant storage and SQL Databases.
    
    - Azure Resource Manager (ARM): is a service that runs in Azure, and it’s responsible for all interaction with Azure services.
                                    In order to make it easier to deploy and manage Azure services.
                                    When you create a new Azure service, ARM authenticates you to make sure you have the right access to create that resource, and then it talks to a resource provider for the service you’re creating.
                                    The flow of a typical ARM request to create or manage a resource is straightforward. A tool such as the Azure portal, command-line tools, or Visual Studio makes a request to the ARM API. 
                                    The API passes that request to ARM where the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the action. ARM then passes the request to a resource provider, and the resource provider creates the new resource or modifies an existing resource.
                                    ARM has many benefits, and you should be aware of these for your exam: 
                                        * ARM allows you to easily deploy multiple Azure resources at once. 
                                        * ARM makes it possible to reproduce any deployment with consistent results at any point in the future. 
                                        * ARM allows you to create declarative templates for deployment instead of requiring you to write and maintain complex deployment scripts.
                                        * ARM makes it possible to set up dependencies so that your resources are deployed in the right order every time.

    - Resource groups: group is a logical container for Azure services. This help you to delaing dealing with a complex array of services.
                       By creating all Azure services associated with a particular application in a single resource group, you can then deploy and manage all of those services as a single entity.
                       Organizing Azure resources in a resource group has many advantages. First of all, you can easily set up deployments using an ARM template.

2.2 DESCRIBE SOME OF THE CORE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN AZURE
    In this skill section, we’ll talk about some of the core Azure products in four different categories:
        * Azure compute:  This refers to the resources that provide computing power to run your applications. Azure offers both IaaS and PaaS compute products.
        * Azure networking:  These products provide connectivity between Azure resources, and to and from the Internet or your on-premises resources.
        * Azure storage:  These products give you secure and reliable cloud storage for your data.
        * Azure database: These products provide highly-scalable solutions for hosting databases of many varieties.

    > AZURE COMPUTE: allow you to easily and dynamically allocate resources that are needed for any computing task.
                     You can create compute resources quickly when you need them, and when your needs grow, you can scale those resources to handle additional requirements.

            * Azure virtual machines: is a software-based computer that runs on a physical computer.
                                      This is an IaaS offering in Azure. VM is susceptible to downtime due to three types of events: 
                    ** planned maintenance: refers to planned updates that Microsoft makes to the host computer.
                    ** unplanned maintenance: In an unplanned maintenance event, Azure will attempt to move your VM to a healthy host computer. 
                                              When it does this, it preserves the state of the VM, including what’s in memory and any files that are open. It only takes Azure a short time to move the VM, during which time it’s in a paused state.
                    ** unexpected downtime: In a case where the move operation fails, the VM will experience unexpected downtime.

                    - Availability sets protect you from maintenance events and downtime caused by hardware failures.
                    To do that, Azure creates some underlying entities in an availability set called [update domains] and [fault domains].
                        - Fault domains: are a logical representation of the physical rack in which a host computer is installed.
                                         By default, Azure assigns two fault domains to an availability set.
                        - Update domains: are designed to protect you from a situation where the host computer is being rebooted.
                                          When you create an availability set, Azure creates five update domains by default.
                                          Protect you from planned maintenance events.
                    
                    - scale sets: When you create a scale set, you tell Azure what operating system you want to run and then you tell Azure 
                        how many VMs you want in your scale set. You have many other options such as creating a load balancer or gateway and so forth.
                        Azure will create as many VMs as you specified (up to 1,000) in one easy step.
                        Scale sets are deployed in availability sets automatically, so you automatically benefit from multiple 
                        fault domains and update domains.
            
            * Containers in Azure: To help with the problem to move applications between “environments,” and to make it easier to shift applications into new environments, 
                the concept of containers was invented. A container is created using a zipped version of an application called an image, and it includes everything the application needs to run.
                Each container operates within an isolated environment. It has its own network, its own storage, and so on.
                Azure offers numerous technologies for hosting containers. Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a PaaS that makes it easy to start a container with minimal configuration.
                [Kubernetes] is a container orchestration service. Kubernetes creates containers in a pod. A pod is a group of related containers, and containers within a pod are able to share resources.
                The computer that Kubernetes pods are running on is called a node or a worker. There will typically be multiple nodes within a Kubernetes instance, and they are all controlled by a master node called the Kubernetes [master].
                The entire environment of the master and all of its nodes is called a Kubernetes [cluster]. 
                AKS offloads the burden of dealing with the Kubernetes master to Microsoft. When you create a Kubernetes cluster in AKS, Azure creates the master and the nodes for you. 
                All you have to do is deploy your containers, and you’re up and running with a managed Kubernetes cluster.

    > AZURE NETWORKING: 
            * Azure virtual network: An Azure virtual network (often called a VNET) allows Azure services to communicate with each other and with the Internet.
            * Azure load balancer: App Service uses a load balancer to scale out a web tier in an application when needed. App Service takes care of ensuring that load is distributed across all of the VMs we’re using.
                                   Azure LoadBalancer spread the load across all your VMs. Azure Load Balancer isn’t just for distributing traffic from the Internet.
            * Azure Application Gateway: is a load balancer that’s specifically designed to deal with HTTP traffic. Because Application Gateway understands HTTP traffic, it can make decisions based on that HTTP traffic.
                                         You can also add Web Application Firewall (WAF) to Application Gateway. WAF is designed to stop known vulnerabilities from making it into your VNET, allowing you to operate in a more secure environment.
 
            * VPN Gateway: In some cases, you may need your application hosted in Azure to talk to an on-premises resource (hybrid cloud scenarios). 
                            VPN Gateway connects your on-premises resources to your Azure VNET using a virtual private network, or VPN.
                                ** Site-to-Site(S2S): Connects your VNET to a single on-premises location.
                                ** Point-to-Site(P2S): Connects one specific on-premises client PC to your VNET.
                                ** VNET-to-VNET: Connects two Azure VNETs to each other.

            * Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN): is an effective way of delivering large files or streaming content over the Internet.
            It makes the downloading of large files much faster by caching the files in multiple geographical locations so that users can get the files from a server as close to them as possible.
            A CDN works by storing a cached version of files on a point-of-presence (POP) server that is located on the outside edge of a network.
            
            * Azure Traffic Manager: is a domain name system (DNS) -based system that’s designed to enhance the speed and reliability of your application.
             Traffic Manager supports public IP addresses connected to Azure VMs, web apps running in App Service, and cloud services hosted in Azure.
             Once you’ve configured your endpoints, you specify routing rules that you want Traffic Manager to apply to them.
             There are many routing rules available in Traffic Manager.
                ** Priority: All traffic is sent to a primary endpoint, but backup endpoints are available in case the primary endpoint experiences an outage.
                ** Weighted: Traffic is distributed across endpoints. By default, all traffic is distributed evenly, but you can specify a weight for each endpoint and traffic will be distributed as you specify.
                ** Performance: Traffic Manager determines the endpoint with the lowest network latency from the user’s location and uses that endpoint.
                ** Geographic: Traffic is routed based on the geographic location of the DNS server that queries Traffic Manager.
                ** Multivalue: Returns all valid endpoints that use the specified Internet protocol version, either IPv4 or IPv6.
                ** Subnet Traffic: is routed based on the end-user IP address range.

            One important thing to remember is that Traffic Manager is DNS-based. That means that a user never directly talks to Traffic Manager. Traffic Manager is only used for the DNS lookup.

    > AZURE STORAGE PRODUCTS: Azure offers many options for storing data. Whether you need to store data temporarily on a disk mounted to a VM, or you need to be able to store data long-term, Azure has an option to fit your needs.
            * Azure Blob Storage: is designed for storing unstructured data, which has no defined structure. That includes text files, images, videos, documents, and much more. An entity stored in Blob Storage is referred to as a blob. 
              There are three types of blobs in Azure Storage:
                    ** Block blobs: Used to store files used by an application.
                    ** Append blobs They are like block blobs, but append blobs are specialized for append operations. For that reason, they are often used to store constantly updated data like diagnostic logs.
                    ** Page blobs: They are used to store virtual hard drive (.vhd) files that are used in Azure virtual machines.

              Blobs are stored in storage containers. A container is used as a means of organizing blobs, so you might have a container for video files, another container for image files, and so on. The choice, however, is entirely up to you.
              The Hot storage tier is for data you need to access often.
              The Cool storage tier is for data that you intend to store for a longer period and not access quite as often.
              Microsoft also offers an Archive storage tier for long-term data storage. Data stored in the Archive tier enjoys the lowest storage costs available, but the access costs are the highest. You must keep data in storage for a minimum of 180 days in the Archive tier.
              You can use Azure Storage Explorer, a free tool available from Microsoft, to upload data.
              If you want to move a large amount of data, Microsoft offers a service called Data Box.
              
              * Azure Queue Storage: A message queue is a component in an application that can store messages that an application uses to know what tasks to take.
                Azure Queue Storage provides a cloud-based message queue that can be accessed securely from application components located anywhere. They

              * Azure Disk Storage: Disk storage in Azure refers to disks that are used in virtual machines. Azure creates a disk for you when you create a VM, which is automatically designated for temporary storage.
                Azure disks are available as both traditional hard disks (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD).
                Azure disks are available as either Managed Disks or unmanaged disks.

              * Azure Files: is a completely managed file share that you can mount just like any SMB file share. That means existing applications that use network attached storage (NAS) devices 
                or SMB file shares can use Azure Files without any special tooling, and if you have multiple applications that need to access the same share, that will work with Azure Files, too.

    > AZURE DATABASE PRODUCTS:
            * Azure SQL Database: is a PaaS offering for SQL Server database hosting. Microsoft manages the platform, so all you have to worry about is your database and the data in it.
              Azure offers three different deployment options for Azure SQL Database: single database, elastic pool, and managed instance.
              Single database purchase models: Database Transaction Unit (DTU) and VCore Model
              Microsoft developed the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) to make it easier for customers to easily move on-premises databases or databases hosted elsewhere in the cloud to a managed instance.
            
            * Azure Cosmos DB: Microsoft offers a hosted NoSQL database system in Azure called Cosmos DB, and Cosmos DB supports all of the NoSQL database types.
              When you create a Cosmos DB database, you choose the API you want to use, and this determines the database type for your database. 
              The database API types are:
                    ** Core (SQL): Creates a document database that you can query using SQL syntax that you might be familiar with from using relational databases.
                    ** Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API Used for migrating a MongoDB database to Cosmos DB. MongoDB databases are document databases.
                    ** Cassandra Used for migrating a Cassandra database to Cosmos DB. Cassandra databases are column databases.
                    ** Azure Table Used for migrating data stored in Azure Table Storage to Cosmos DB. This creates a key-value database.
                    ** Gremlin Used for migrating Gremlin databases to Cosmos DB. Gremlin databases are graph databases.
            
            * The Azure Marketplace and its usage scenarios: there are many available products outside of what we’ve discussed. Not only does Microsoft offer many additional services,
             but third-party vendors also provide a wide array of resources you can use in Azure. All of these resources are available in a single repository called the Azure Marketplace.

SKILL 2.3: DESCRIBE SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE ON AZURE
    * Internet of Things (IoT): To help companies manage devices and handle the data they are collecting, Azure has several services that are targeted at IoT, including IoT Hub and IoT Central.
            ** Azure IoT Hub: it's a service where the IoT devices are added and and you can then manage them, monitor them, and send messages to them, either individually or to groups that you create. 
               You can add up to 1,000,000 IoT devices to a single IoT Hub. From IoT Hub, you can send messages to devices (called cloud-to-device, or C2D messaging) or 
               from your device to IoT Hub (called device-to-cloud, or D2C messaging). In addition to messages, you can also use IoT Hub to send files to your devices. This allows you to easily update 
               the firmware on your devices in a secure way.
               Every IoT device in IoT Hub has a logical equivalent that’s stored in IoT Hub in JSON format. This JSON representation of the device is called a device twin, and it provides important capabilities.
               To help with users who want to add a large number of IoT devices to IoT Hub, Microsoft offers the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, or DPS.

            ** Azure IoT Central: If you’re looking for a first-class experience in monitoring IoT devices without having to do complex configuration, IoT Central is a good choice.
               IoT Central is a SaaS offering for IoT devices. Unlike IoT Hub, you don’t have to create any Azure resources to use IoT Central. Instead, 
               you browse to https://apps.azureiotcentral.com and create your app within the web browser interface.
               IoT Central also allows you to easily configure rules that will monitor your devices and perform an action you choose when your rule is activated. In
