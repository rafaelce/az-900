1.1 DESCRIBE THE BENEFITS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF USING CLOUD SERVICES:
> High Availabity: 
    SLA (Service-level agreement): Garante um certo nível de disponibilidade em porcentagem. 
                                    Garante um tempo de atividade de cerca de 100%
    - Network outage:
    - Application failure:  Application Inseghts integration with your application to give you detailed 
                            information about the performance and reliability of your application.
    - System outage: 
    - Power outage
    - Problems with a reliant system

> Scalability, Elasticity and agility
 * Scalability: horizontal scaling (scaling out) aumenta o número de VM´s.
                verical scaling (scaling up) aumenta o poder da VM's.
 * Elasticity: thw concept of automatically scaling based on the usage patter for your application.
 * Agility: kind of speed and flexibility to quickly scale in the cloud.

 > Fault tolerance and disaster recovery: Is designed to deal with failure at a small scale, moving you,
 for example, from an unhealthy VM to a healthy VM. Disaster recovery plans are commonly referred to as 
 Business Continuaty and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans.

 > Economic benefits of the cloud: 
    - On-Promises Model (Modelo Local): 
    - Cloud Model (Modelo em nuvem): offers many economic benefits over the op-promises model

1.2 DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE (IAAS), 
    PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE (PAAS), AND SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS): Offerings in the cloud are typically 
    referred as a services. Each type of service comes with advantages and disadvantages.

    IaaS: Infrastructure refers to the hardware that your application uses, and IaaS refers to the 
    virtualized infrastructure offered by a cloud provider. Iaas services allow you to control costs effectively,
    because your only pay for them when you are using them. Iaas benefit from scaling and elasticity.
